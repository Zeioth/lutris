Styling conventions 
==================

Should I edit the script of a game I like?
=======================

Good reasons (75% chance of being accepted)
----------------------------------
* The script is unmaintained and/or it's not working anymore, 
  so it needs to be rewritten.
* The installer hasn't been updated in the last week, 
  and there are some new patches that can improve the game's performance.
* Periodic wine and DXVK updates: If you actually tested them.

Proceed with caution (25% chance of being accepted)
----------------------------------

* The script is already maintained, but I'd like to add some feature that I personally like: 
Be aware that even if you are personally interested on x feature, maybe it's not a reason good enough to add extra complexity to the script.

Bad reasons (5% chance of being accepted)
---------------------------------- 

* A cool feature that is only gonna work for this installer (Unless there's a powerful reason for it). 
  IE: "I wan't to make possible to choose if DXVK_HUD is vissible for this game while you install it". 
  Even if it looks like a good idea on first instance, new users might not care about it, 
  and advanced users already know how to do it.

A moderator rejected my script
----------------------------------

* First of all, they don't hate you. Mods love contributors.
* By following the rules described in this document, you are maximizing the chances to be accepted.
* Please, don't make 100 editions just because your first edition wasn't accepted. 
  Maybe the game you are trying to contribute already has a huge number of contributors. 
  If you are really commited to help others, try to contribute to games which are not so popular, or unattended games.
  
How many edits are too much?
----------------------------------
Ideally you should submit ONE edit for moderation per game, and per day, as maximum (unless you need to submit a hotfix). But you can contribute to as many games as you want. 

The game I want to edit is locked
----------------------------------
Locked games already have a main contributor who usually is a well known and active member of the comunity. So they will fix the installer as soon as they notice. If you think they are not aware of a problem, you can contact them on Discord, or open a new issue on Lutris.

How to properly edit an installer
=======================

Description
----------------------------------
Ideally, this paragraph should be empty. Use it only to give short and useful information. Example [1](https://i.imgur.com/A6mL8hI.png).

Technical notes
----------------------------------
If the game needs some kind of manual tweak, you can speak about it here. Examples: [1](https://i.imgur.com/zaTzFHQ.png), [2](https://i.imgur.com/0f5TYdo.png).

Reason
----------------------------------
This paragraph is meant to help Lutris moderators to understand what you are trying to do. Example [1](https://i.imgur.com/F0tmrhy.png).

Tips:
* Try to avoid confusing, or redundant info.
* If you are editing something really obvious, it's better to leave this field empty.
